# Meme Generator

This 'meme generator' web page is a fun coding challenge I worked on to familiarise myself with the Document Object Model, to start making my web pages more interactive. 
The web page presents four prompts for the user to choose from, so the user can decide to be presented with either a meme, a joke, a quote or a riddle. Each time the user
clicks on one of the four options the previously shown piece of content is cleared before the new one is displayed. The project also includes a small amount of error handling
for when the user clicks on the 'reveal riddle answer' before a riddle is displayed, or after the answer has been revealed.

To view the webpage please copy and paste the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files into your code editor and run it from there. I hope you enjoy playing around with it.
